# `data-structure<%= package.name %>`

## Usage

Currently this project isn't being published to the public `npm` registry, but you can develop locally using it by modifying the project itself and running `npm test`. You can also create additional packages and add `data-structure<%= package.name %>` in the `package.json` of that package and run `npm run lerna -- bootstrap` to bring that as a dependency to the new project.

## Developing

For development, feel free to modify the implementation or its corresponding tests. To run tests, just run `npm test` in the root directory. You can also run `Flow` for type-checking by running `npm run typecheck`.
