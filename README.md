# Interview Questions & Resources [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joshblack/interview.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joshblack/interview)

Collection of interview questions and resources for JavaScript developers.

## Project Structure

This project now follows a monorepo design, powered by [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna). The `packages` folder contains modules for data structure implementations, algorithms, as well as questions.

`wiki` will contain a variety of write-ups for important concepts as I tackle more and more interview questions.
