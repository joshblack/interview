Collection of interview questions and resources for JavaScript developers.

## Project Structure

- `modules`: implementation of various algorithms or common interview questions
  - each folder has a `__tests__` folder that includes tests for the problem/algorithm
- `wiki`: will contain a variety of write-ups for important concepts as I tackle more and more interview questions
